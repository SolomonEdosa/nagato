<P>My name is Solomon , also known as naga. i am still a student of the university of Benin, Edo state. where i study EARLY CHILDHHOOD EDUCATION, under the department of EDUCATION. I have always loved evolving and learning new things. luckily for me i was born and brought up in a family where my parents and siblings love technology and that certainly contributed to my love for technology also because i was introduced to it at a young age...........Basically i was burdened with the weight of "what will i do after school" because unlike most courses and professions in Nigeria , Education is not given much resspect like Medicine, law and the likes of banking but along the line i was introduced to ALT SCHOOL africa and it has been a rollercoaster of many emotions . Innitially filled with curiosity about what the school was about, to currious about if i passed the entrance exam. and then finally pasiing the entrance exam and then being filled with happiness, and now finding my feet and struggling to juggle both actual school classes and that on ALT SCHOOL . but i am honestly grateful for the oppurtunity and intend to utilize it in productive ways. </P>
